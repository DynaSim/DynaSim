%% iGABAb: scaled synaptic GABA-B-ergic inhibitory current
% This is an adaptation of the GABA-B current from (Vijayan and Kopell, 2012).
%
% The state variable [R] for GABAB is 'customized' here, in that, rather
%     than the popular formulation of a 0.5 mM box 0.3 ms long for the
%     transmitter amount, inherited from (Destexhe 1996), the VERY similar
%     2 * (1 + tanh( V / 4) ) method of calculating transmitter concentration
%     from (Olufsen 2003) is used. 0.3 ms is about as long as a neuron's
%     voltage is above 0 mV, the latter being the definition of when this
%     voltage-sensitive transmitter concentration is non-zero. The same
%     concentration amplitude was used since I had already seen a long time
%     of realistic results with GABAA responding to it, and GABAB's effect
%     obviously has a much more malleable effector in its maximal conductance.
%
% In many ways, this is a simplified version of the GABA-B current from (Vijayan
%     2012): instead of a fixed spike of transmitter concentration when the
%     presynaptic cell spikes, we use the same GABA concentration calculation
%     method from the GABA-A current.

% Connectivity
% 'ones' so all-to-all connectivity

% Functions
% Note that because of `gGABAb./sum(netcon)`, the total current to the target is scaled
%   down by the number of source cells.
IGABAb(X,g) = gGABAb./scaleFactor.*((g.^4./(g.^4 + 100))*netcon).*(X-EGABAb)

% This way we record the synaptic currents!
