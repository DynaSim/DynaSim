 function [mival, mi_angle, mi_comodulogram, modulation_index] = mi_measure(phase_sig, amp_sig, calc_comodulograms)
% function mival = mi_measure(phase_sig, amp_sig)
%
% Returns a value for the MI measure calculated between two signals.
% (Functionality to deal with multiple trials will be added soon)
%
% INPUTS:
%
% phase_sig - the instantaneous phase values for a signal which has been
% filtered for a lower, modulating frequency, passed as a column vector
%
% amp_sig - the amplitude values for a signal which has been filtered for a
% higher, modulated frequency, passed as a column vector
