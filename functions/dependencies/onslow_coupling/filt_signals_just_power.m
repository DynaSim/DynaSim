% function [ph_filt_signals, amp_filt_signals] = filt_signalsWAV(sig1,sig2,...
% Fs, ph_freq_vec, amp_freq_vec, measure, width)
%
% Returns cell arrays 'ph_filt_signals' and 'amp_filt_signals'. These 
% contain 'sig1' and 'sig2' correctly filtered in order to calculate the
% PAC measure, either ESC or MI given by 'measure'. The frequencies
% to filter at are determined by the vectors 'ph_freq_vec' and
% 'amp_freq_vec'. The frequency range is defined by the minimum and the
% maximum value and the interval, or bandwith, between values. For example
% if 'ph_freq_vec' is defined as 1:5:101 ([1, 6, 11, 16, 21...101]) then
% the centre frequencies that will be filtered for are [3, 8, 13, 18...98]
% i.e. the centre of the 5 Hz bins from 1 Hz to 101 Hz. Filtering is
% achieved via convolution with a complex Morlet wavelet (number of cycles 
% defined by 'width' parameter). 
%
% INPUTS:
% sig1 - signal which will be analysed as containing the higher frequency,
% modulated PAC signal
% sig2 - signal which will be analysed as containing the lower frequency,
% modulating signal
% Fs - sampling frequency, in Hz
% ph_freq_vec - vector of frequencies to filter sig2 for, in Hz
% amp_freq_vec - vector of frequencies to filter sig1 for, in Hz
% measure - PAC measure which will be calculated using these filtered
% signals
% width - number of cycles which will define the mother Morlet wavelet
%
% OUTPUTS:
% ph_filt_signals - 1 x (number of bins determined by ph_freq_vec) cell 
% array, each element has the same dimensions as the original signals
% amp_filt_signals - 1 x (number of bins determined by amp_freq_vec) cell 
% array, each element has the same dimensions as the original signals
