function [matched,error_message] = checkHostPaths(studyinfo)
%CHECKHOSTPATHS - Compare paths on host to those set in studyinfo when batch was created
%
% Call ds.checkHostPaths() in job.m before first simulation to make sure the
% paths on the compute matchine match those in studyinfo created when the
% study was began.
%
% If paths do not match, an informative error message is added to
% .error_log (see ds.createBatch() or any jobX.m script).
%
% Usage:
%   ds.checkHostPaths(studyinfo)
%
% Inputs:
%   - studyinfo: DynaSim studyinfo structure
%
% Outputs:
%   - matched: {0 or 1} (whether the paths match or not)
%
% Paths compared:
% - path to DynaSim functions
% - path to model files
